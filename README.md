## idea of natural selection
The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.

there are 5 phases mainly considered:
-Initial population
-Fitness function
-Selection
-Crossover
-Mutation

the goal in this algorithm was to find an individual with a fitness of 5 (all black or all white boxes)
